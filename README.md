# GUI-Calculator-using-Python

The calculator is one application that we all use in our day to day
lives.Calculator is a project which is easy and useful at same time.We are going
to build a GUI Calculator using Kivy module, which is a platform-independent
GUI tool in Python. As it can be run on Android, IOS, linux and Windows etc.
GUI calculator is only a calculator but one can use it by clicking buttons, not by
typing something like in python print(2+2) , and then will get the result as 4 in
the black and white environment. In the GUI calculator, all its operators and
numbers are represented graphically and one can click it and use it.
